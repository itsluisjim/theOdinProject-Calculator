# The Odin Project - Calculator Project

Using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, I completed The Odin Project's calculator project. This was one of the most challenging projects I have tackled as a novice, but with the guidance of several YouTubers, I was able to create a fully functioning hand-held calculator. Shoutout to all those who provided their expertise and made this project possible.
